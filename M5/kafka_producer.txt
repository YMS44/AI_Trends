Producer
—----------
$kafka-console-producer.sh

1) Produce messages
So we are going to launch our first kafka-console-producer.
>>>>$kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic
2) So give following command
>>>>$kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic 
    --producer-property acks=all
And again, we get the little carrot starting, start entering the messages as shown



Consumer
—-----------
$kafka-console-consumer.sh

1) Consume/read the messages
Open a new terminal window (say console consumer window)
so let's give it a try.
>>>>kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic

2) But how do we do to read all the messages in the topic?
But how do we do to read all the messages in the topic? 
Because sometimes we need to. 
So, we launch the exact same command. But this time, we will do from beginning.
And by doing from beginning, we are going to ask console consumer to go to the 
beginning of topic and tell what the other is.
^C(Ctrl + C) the console consumer terminal, and again give following command
>>>>$kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --from-beginning

Consumer Group
—--------------------

1) Creating console consumer belonging to the group
In third CLI (consumer1 cli) give following command
>>>>kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server 127.0.0.1:9092 --topic first_topic --group my-first-application
So as we expect, this is a new console consumer and it's part of the 
my-first-application group and because we don't read from beginning, 
well we don't see any messages.
