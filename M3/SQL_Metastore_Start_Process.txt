Saprk SQL is having a dependency on Hive Metastore
Hive Metastore is having a dependency on hadoop
Hadoop is made up of
1) HDFS (Storage)
2) YARN (Cluster Resource Manager) 
3) MR (Distributated Programming Framework)

HDFS (Storage) is having following daemon processes
NameNode
DataNode
SecondaryNameNode

YARN (Cluster Resource Manager) is having following daemon processes
ResourceManager
NodeManager

MR (Distributated Programming Framework) won't have any daemon processes

Sequence will be
1) Start HDFS
ls -lh *.sh
head -n 10 run-hdfs.sh
hdfs namenode -format
./run-hdfs.sh -s start
jps

2) Start YARN
head -n 10 run-yarn.sh
./run-yarn.sh -s start
jps

then make directory accodingly
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/talentum

3) Start Hive Metastore
head -n 10 run-hivemetastore.sh
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/hive/warehouse
./run-hivemetastore.sh -s start
jps [note : there should RunJar process]
4) Implement Spark SQL application
